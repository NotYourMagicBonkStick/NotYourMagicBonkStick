### C++ stands for Pacman

I code for fun and to build myself the tools that I need such as file management programs.

The code may suck but at least it works when I run it.

Also AI has been proven that it should have stayed inside the dishwasher. It stands for Automated Idiot and nothing more.

Btw, tell that filthy arch user, that I got Debian and it is better.
